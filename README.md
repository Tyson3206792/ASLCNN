# ASLCNN
American Sign Language Convolutional Neural Network.

This program attempts to interpret ASL hand gestures for 27 images classes (A-Z and space). It uses a Convolutional Neural Network 
trained on a few hundred images for each of the classes.

Repo contains web code, python script (mini_batch_loading_model.ipynb) used for training
and series of models created during development (trained_models).
